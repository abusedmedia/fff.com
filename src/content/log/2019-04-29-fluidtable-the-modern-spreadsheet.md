Fluidtable the modern spreadsheet

I think this is a great idea, [Fluidtable](https://fluidtable.com/), a spreadsheet tool that uses javascript as formulas language.

I've always struggled with keep in memory the spreadsheet syntax. 

Using plain javascript is simply great to boost productivity in the spreadsheet world.

Hope it will take off well.
